## Content Coverage

### Forest Types

#### Tropical Forests
- **Evergreen**: Wet (>200cm), Semi-Evergreen (175-225cm), Dry (~100cm)
- **Deciduous**: Moist (100-200cm), Dry (75-100cm)
- **Thorn**: Arid (<50cm)

#### Coastal Forests
- **Littoral & Swamp (Mangroves)**: India has ~7% of world's mangroves

#### Mountain Forests
- **Alpine/Montane**: Northern Mountains (Himalayas), Southern Mountains (Western Ghats Sholas)

### Data Points for Each Forest Type
- Rainfall requirements
- Temperature ranges
- Geographic locations (states, regions)
- Characteristic tree species
- Special features and adaptations
- Sub-types and variations
- Ecological importance

## Key Coverage

- **Dry Evergreen**: Tamil Nadu coast
- **Mangroves**: Sundarbans, A&N Islands, Mahanadi/Godavari/Krishna deltas
- **Sholas**: Nilgiris, Annamalai, Palani hills (Western Ghats)

### Characteristic Trees

### Forest Statistics (Latest Report)
- **Total forest & tree cover**: 8,27,357 sq km (25.17% of geographical area)
- **Forest cover**: 7,15,343 sq km (21.76%)
- **Tree cover**: 1,12,014 sq km (3.41%)
- **Recommended for ecological stability**: 33% (still below target)
- **Mangrove cover**: 4,992 sq km
- **8 states/UTs with >75% cover**: Mizoram, Lakshadweep, A&N, Arunachal, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur

### State Rankings

### Concerns
- Decline in mangrove cover by 7.43 sq km
- Western Ghats ESA lost 58.22 km² in 10 years
- North-East India declined by 327.30 sq km

### Special Features
- **Mangrove adaptations**: Viviparity, Pneumatophores
- **British impact**: Replaced Oaks with Pine (1000-2000m) for Railways
- **Bugyals**: Grasslands at 3000-4000m in Himalayas
- **Alpine tundra**: Beyond tree line in Himalayas (NOT in Western Ghats due to height limitation)
- **Sholas**: Temperate evergreen forests in Western Ghats
- **Northern Himalayan slopes**: Little vegetation (devoid of sunlight)

### Global Recognition
- **FAO Report**: India gained 2,66,000 hectares annually (2010-2020)
- **Global rank**: 3rd in forest gains (after China, Australia)

## Study Tips

1. Start with the major tropical forest types (Evergreen, Deciduous, Thorn)
2. Remember rainfall ranges for each sub-type
3. Focus on characteristic tree species
4. Learn mangrove adaptations (Viviparity, Pneumatophores)
5. Understand altitudinal zonation in mountains (1000-2000m, 3000-4000m, beyond tree line)
6. Know why Western Ghats don't have alpine tundra (height limitation)
7. Remember state rankings and statistics
8. Understand conservation concerns (mangrove decline, Western Ghats loss)
